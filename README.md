# libcwalk - path library for C/C++
This library is intended to be a lighweight C path manipulation library. 
It is currently compiled and tested under **Windows**, **MacOS** and **Linux**. 
It supports UNIX and Windows path styles on all platforms.

## WARNING
This is a work in progress and not yet ready to use.

## Features
Please have a look at the **[reference](https://github.com/likle/cwalk/wiki/Reference)** for detailed information.
Basically the library can be used to do things like:

 * Combine multiple paths together
 * Extract the basename of a path
 * Get the dirname of a path
 * Read extension from a file path
 * Normalize/cleanup paths
 * Resolve relative paths
 * Path segment iteration
